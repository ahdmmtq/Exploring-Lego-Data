# Exploring-Lego-Data

The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! 

In this project, I worked on analyzing data set and exploring it through exploratory data analysis techniques using my knowledge in:
- Python
- Pandas
- Data importing & cleaning
- Data manipulation
- Data visualization

Tasks included:
- Reading Data
- Exploring Colors
- Transparent Colors in Lego Sets
- Explore Lego Sets
- Analyzing Lego Themes Over Years
- Visualization of results
